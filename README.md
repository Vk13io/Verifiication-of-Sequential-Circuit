Verification of Ring Counter using UVM TB


# Ring Counter Verification with UVM

## Project Overview

This project is designed to verify a **Ring Counter** implemented in RTL using **UVM** (Universal Verification Methodology). The project structure is organized into multiple directories, each serving a specific purpose. It includes RTL source files, UVM testbench files, simulation scripts, and test cases.

## Test Scenarios
The following test scenarios are applied to verify the Ring Counter:

1. **Basic Ring Counter Operation**: Verify the basic counter behavior and check the cyclic pattern.
2. **Boundary Conditions**: Check the behavior when the counter reaches its maximum or minimum value.
3. **Reset Behavior**: Ensure the counter resets correctly to its initial state.
4. **Clock Enable**: Test the counter's response to the enable signal, verifying that it works when the clock is enabled.
5. **Edge Cases**: Verify the counter behavior for edge cases such as when the reset and enable are toggled at the same time.
6. **Sequencer Validation**: Ensure that the UVM sequencer drives the correct sequence of operations to the DUT.

## Testbench Details
### UVM Testbench Components

- **Ring Agent**: The agent drives stimulus and monitors the response of the Ring Counter DUT. It includes a driver and a monitor.
- **Ring Driver**: The driver applies sequences to the DUT, including clock and reset signals.
- **Ring Monitor**: The monitor observes signals from the DUT and sends them to the scoreboard for comparison with expected values.
- **Ring Scoreboard**: The scoreboard checks the correctness of the DUT's output by comparing it against expected results.
- **Ring Environment**: The environment includes the UVM agents, scoreboard, and the test sequences. It configures the agents
